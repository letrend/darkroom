CRITICAL WARNING: [Netlist 29-73] Incorrect value '20.0' specified for property 'CLKIN_PERIOD'. The system will either use the default value or the property value will be dropped. Verify your source files. [/home/letrend/workspace/darkroom/ise_files/mojo_top.ngc:1309]

WARNING: [Netlist 29-43] Netlist 'mojo_top' is not ideal for floorplanning, since the cellview 'mojo_top' defined in file 'mojo_top.ngc' contains large number of primitives.  Please consider enabling hierarchy in synthesis if you want to do floorplanning.
